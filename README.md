## Parts:

The PCB uses push to connect terminal blocks. The part footprint is designed to allow any style connector that's typically found in this spacing.

We tend to use the Combicon PTSA family of [pheonix contacts](https://www.digikey.com/short/zdrh8825) ordering yellow and green pairs and then manually assemble them in alternating colors. Works with stripped wire (no connector/ferrule required) 16-24 awg.  
These connectors are also typically stocked at mouser. They can also be had from ebay/[aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32880938989.html). We haven't had problems with the off-brand ones, but YMMV.
